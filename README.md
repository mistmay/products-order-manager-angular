# ProductOrderManager

Simple Product and order manager made with Angular Material

In order to signup, login and see the website, you need to use json-server (you can install it with npm install -g json-server) and then go in the terminal in the project folder (you must be in this folder) and run json-server --watch db.json in the default port localhost:3000. This will simulate a fake simple backend with the right json structure, so you can post and get users details.

try the app by running ng serve in the principal directory.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
